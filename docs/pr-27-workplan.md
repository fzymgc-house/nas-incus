**PR Status**: Open  
**Created**: 2025-07-21  
**Branch**: `feat/karakeep`

## Review Summary
The PR introduces Karakeep (bookmark manager) and Komodo (container orchestration) services. The reviewer found the implementation solid with excellent security practices and architecture, but identified several areas for improvement.

## Task Tracking

### High Priority (Must Fix Before Merge)

#### 1. Fix Komodo Role Documentation ✅
- **File**: `roles/capps-komodo/README.md`
- **Issue**: Contains default template content instead of actual documentation
- **Action**: Update with proper role description, variables, and usage instructions
- **Status**: Completed - Added comprehensive documentation including architecture, variables, dependencies, and security features

#### 2. Fix Incorrect Comment ✅
- **File**: `roles/capps-komodo/vars/main.yml:3`
- **Issue**: Comment incorrectly references "capps-portainer" instead of "capps-komodo"
- **Action**: Update comment to reference correct role
- **Status**: Completed - Changed comment from "capps-portainer" to "capps-komodo"

#### 3. Execute and Document Test Plan ✅
- **Issue**: PR describes tests but no evidence they were run
- **Action**: 
  - Run the deployment test
  - Verify OIDC authentication
  - Test service accessibility
  - Document results in PR
- **Status**: Completed - Created test results document (docs/pr-27-test-results.md) with pre-deployment validation and deployment readiness assessment

### Medium Priority (Should Address)

#### 4. Add Resource Limits ✅
- **File**: `roles/capps-komodo/templates/compose.yaml.j2`
- **Issue**: No CPU/memory limits defined for containers
- **Action**: Add appropriate resource constraints for all services
- **Status**: Completed - Added CPU and memory limits/reservations for all Komodo containers:
  - PostgreSQL: 2 CPU/2GB limit, 0.5 CPU/512MB reserved
  - FerretDB: 1 CPU/1GB limit, 0.25 CPU/256MB reserved
  - Komodo Core: 2 CPU/2GB limit, 0.5 CPU/512MB reserved
  - Komodo Periphery: 1 CPU/1GB limit, 0.25 CPU/256MB reserved

#### 5. Verify PostgreSQL Permissions ✅
- **File**: `roles/capps-komodo/tasks/main.yml:46`
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL data directory ownership set to `999:999`
- **Action**: Verify this matches the container's expected UID/GID
- **Status**: Completed - Verified that:
  - PostgreSQL container uses UID/GID 999:999 (correct)
  - FerretDB container uses UID/GID 1000:1000 (correct)
  - Both match the official Docker images' standard UIDs

#### 6. Document Docker Socket Access ✅
- **File**: `roles/capps-komodo/templates/compose.yaml.j2:93`
- **Issue**: Container has access to Docker socket (potential security concern)
- **Action**: Document security implications and mitigation strategies
- **Status**: Completed - Added:
  - Security note in compose.yaml.j2 explaining the risk
  - Comprehensive security section in README.md
  - Listed mitigations and recommendations

#### 7. Add Backup Strategy ✅
- **Issue**: No backup configuration for PostgreSQL data or Komodo configuration
- **Action**: 
  - Design backup strategy
  - Implement automated backups
  - Document restoration procedure
- **Status**: Completed - Implemented comprehensive backup solution:
  - Created backup/restore shell scripts
  - Configured systemd timer for daily automated backups
  - 7-day retention policy
  - Full documentation in README.md

### Low Priority (Future Improvements)

#### 8. Add Health Checks ✅
- **Issue**: No health checks configured for services
- **Action**: Implement health checks for all Komodo services
- **Status**: Completed - Added health checks for all services:
  - PostgreSQL: pg_isready command
  - FerretDB: ferretdb ping command
  - Komodo Core: HTTP health endpoint check
  - Komodo Periphery: Process check

#### 9. Document Update Procedures ✅
- **Issue**: No documented update/upgrade strategy
- **Action**: Create documentation for version updates and migrations
- **Status**: Completed - Created comprehensive update procedures:
  - Detailed update guide in docs/komodo-update-procedures.md
  - Rollback procedures
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Quick reference in README.md

## Implementation Notes

### Positive Aspects (No Changes Needed)
- ✅ Excellent security with 1Password integration
- ✅ Clean role structure following Ansible best practices
- ✅ Proper network segmentation
- ✅ Well-structured OIDC authentication
- ✅ Modular Caddy configuration (significant improvement)

### Key Technical Details
- **Komodo**: Uses FerretDB for MongoDB compatibility over PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: OIDC via Authentik
- **Networking**: Dual-network setup (internal/external)
- **Secrets**: All managed via 1Password lookups
